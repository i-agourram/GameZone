        <p class="fortnitetext1">Fortnite is a survival game where 100 players fight against each other in player versus player 
            combat to be the last one standing. It is a fast-paced, action-packed game, not unlike The Hunger Games, where 
            strategic thinking is a must in order to survive. There are an estimated 125 million players on Fortnite.</p>
