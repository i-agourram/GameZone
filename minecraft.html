        <p class="minecrafttext1">Minecraft is a game where players place blocks and go on adventures.
            This includes anything from crafting simple items like containers or weapons, to building structures like
            houses, castles,
            and cities, or even making complex mechanical-devices, all within the gameâ€™s world. Think of it like an
            endless
            world of complex LEGOs that allows players to imagine, design, and create anything they dream up.</p>

        <h1>TRAVEL THE NETHER</h1>
        <p class="minecrafttext2">The Nether is the second dimension in Minecraft, and can be accessed via the main Overworld using a Nether
            Portal. It is an extremely inhospitable dimension located completely underground, and has innumerable
            amounts of lavafalls that pool into the bottom of the Nether's biomes.</p>
